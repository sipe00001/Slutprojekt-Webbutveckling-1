            <h1>Falcon</h1>
            <p>Samuel Thomas "Sam" Wilson, better known as Falcon, is a former United States Air Force pararescue airman who left active duty when his wing-man Riley died in combat, choosing instead to begin helping any of his fellow veterans who were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder at Veterans Affairs. During this time, Wilson met and soon became an ally of Captain America during the beginning of the HYDRA Uprising, assisting him in bringing down Alexander Pierce's schemes for Project Insight before then choosing to remain with Captain America for future missions.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Military Career</h3>
            <p>Sam Wilson joined the United States Air Force, after qualifying and passing all the requirements for pararescue, serving two combat tours in the Global War on Terrorism campaign. Assigned to the 58th Rescue Squadron, he was a test pilot for the EXO-7 Falcon along with his wingman, Riley. One of his missions involved successfully capturing Khalid Khandil in Bakhmala, Afghanistan. During another rescue mission, Riley was killed after he was hit by an RPG and Wilson could do nothing to save him. After losing his friend, Wilson found that he had a hard time trying to find a reason to continue serving and soon left the military and focused his efforts on helping veterans suffering from combat Post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>

            <h3>Meeting Captain America</h3>
            <br>
            <p>Having returned home from the United States Air Force, Wilson was hired by the Department of Veterans Affairs, intending of helping people suffering from Posttraumatic stress disorder. While out on his morning jog across Washington, D.C., Wilson soon found his early morning exercise being interrupted by Steve Rogers, who managed to casually run past Wilson several times, teasing him as he went much to Wilson's annoyance. As Wilson had stopped to catch his breath, the two talked about being veterans and similarities while serving in a war zone.</p>
