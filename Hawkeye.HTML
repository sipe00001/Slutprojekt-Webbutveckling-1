            <h1>Hawkeye</h1>
            <p>Clinton Francis "Clint" Barton, also known as Hawkeye, is a skilled marksman, a former special agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. and one of the founding members of the Avengers. Known for his use of the bow and arrow as his primary weapon, Barton had become one of the best agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., responsible for the recruitment of Black Widow, whom he developed a strong friendship with. Assigned by Nick Fury into watching over the Tesseract, he was brainwashed by Loki and used as a pawn for all his evil schemes. However, following their Attack on the Helicarrier, he was freed from Loki's mental control by Black Widow and joined the Avengers to fight against Loki's Chitauri army in the Battle of New York, ending Loki's Invasion before Hawkeye had returned to his work as a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Clinton Barton was born in Waverly, Iowa to Edith Barton. Barton would never finish high school, for unknown reasons. Barton would develop a unique talent for marksmanship, mainly with a bow and arrow, and had become renowned as the "Greatest Living Marksman on the Planet." Later in his life, Barton had met a woman named Laura and formed a romantic relationship with her. Eventually, Barton married Laura and would go on to have three children.</p>

            <h4>Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.</h4>
            <br>
            <p>Clint Barton was hand picked by Nick Fury for his leadership abilities, strategic prowess, combat skills, and his tendency to do what he believes is right even when that conflicts with his commanding officers' orders. Barton would soon come to be one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s most elite agents. Of his associates, only Fury knew about his relationship with Laura and he excluded her and their children from all Barton's S.H.I.E.L.D. file in order to protect them, as well as setting up a farmhouse in Missouri where they could live in secrecy. During his mission, Barton had been targeted for assassination by Marcus Scarlotti. Through Barton thwarted the attempt on his life, Scarlotti came closer than anyone else to successfully assassinating Barton.</p>
