            <h1>Winter Soldier</h1>
            <p>Sergeant James Buchanan "Bucky" Barnes is a World War II veteran, a former officer of the 107th Infantry Regiment and the best friend of Steve Rogers since childhood. Barnes was conscripted and assigned to the 107th in 1943. His regiment was captured by HYDRA, where Barnes was experimented on by HYDRA scientist Arnim Zola. Barnes, along with what remained of his regiment, were later rescued by Rogers, who had become Captain America during Barnes' military absence. Joining forces in the continuing war, Barnes and Rogers formed the Howling Commandos to battle the Red Skull's forces. During an attempt to capture Zola, Barnes was caught in an ambush and plummeted hundreds of feet from a train. As no body was ever recovered, he was then presumed dead, but officially listed as MIA.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>James Buchanan Barnes was born on March 10, 1917 and was the eldest child of four. Barnes grew up to be an overachiever, having been an excellent athlete who had also excelled inside the classroom. Sometime during his childhood, he met Steve Rogers when bullies were trying to steal his money. The two became best friends and stuck together for many years, with Barnes often defending Rogers from bullies who would have attempted to take advantage of Rogers' short height and small build.</p>
            <br>
            <h3>HYDRA's Operative</h3>
            <p>Due to his enhanced physiology produced by HYDRA's experiments, Barnes was just able to survive the fall from the train, though his left arm was ripped from his body upon impact. His nearly lifeless body was discovered by a Soviet soldier sometime later. After being discovered, he was handed over to HYDRA's Soviet wing.[10] He was kept their prisoner for many years, until Arnim Zola was released from the SSR's custody, wishing to continue his experiments.</p>
