            <h1>Ant-Man</h1>
            <p>Scott Edward Harris Lang is a former criminal who was convinced by Pym Technologies CEO Hank Pym to take up his mantle as the new Ant-Man. As Ant-Man, Lang fought against Darren Cross, Pym's protégé who became obsessed with Pym Particles and intended to recreate and sell the technology to terrorist organizations such as HYDRA and the Ten Rings. After his daughter, Cassie Lang, was taken hostage by Cross, Lang was able to send both of them into the Quantum Realm, where he saw Pym's wife Janet van Dyne, before successfully returning. Cross was presumably killed. Lang then began a romantic relationship with Pym's daughter, Hope van Dyne.</p>

            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Scott Lang had earned a master's degree in electrical engineering. With his skills, he would often steal from criminals and give back to those they had stolen from.[1] Lang married a woman named Maggie sometime before 2008.[2] Maggie was very supportive of Lang, but disliked his robberies, albeit from criminals. The couple later had a daughter they named Cassandra "Cassie" Lang. Wishing to support his own family, Lang promised his wife that he would stop stealing after Cassie's birth.</p>

            <h3>The VistaCorp Job</h3>
            <p>Lang discovered that Vistacorp was overcharging its customers. At first, he thought it was simply a coding error and changed it. He then realized the company was intentionally doing this to their customers for financial gain when Geoff Zorick, ordered Lang to revert his many corrections before firing him. Angered by VistaCorp's larceny, Lang broke into the Vistacorp Headquarters to hack their systems and pay back the money to Vistacorp's customers. He then broke into Geoff Zorick's Mansion and stole a few items before he got carried away and drove Zorick's car into the mansion's pool.</p>
