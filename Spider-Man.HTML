            <h1>Spider-Man</h1>
            <p>Peter Benjamin Parker is a high school student who gained spider-like abilities, fighting crime across New York City as the alter ego of Spider-Man, hoping some day he'll live up to his heroes in the Avengers. While Parker juggled all his continued superhero duties with the demands of his high-school life, he was approached by Tony Stark who recruited Spider-Man to join the Avengers Civil War, putting Spider-Man into the brief conflict with his personal hero, Captain America. Parker then agreed and was given his new suit as well as brand new Stark technology in exchange for all his help, although Stark still did not make him an official member of the Avengers and instead returned Parker back home to continue his own hero work.</p>
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>Peter Benjamin Parker was born in Queens, New York City on August 10, 2001. During his childhood, Parker was orphaned by his parents and went on to live with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben, the latter of whom died later in his life. Parker grew up and was educated at Midtown School of Science and Technology; there, he made friends like Ned Leeds, who became his best friend but was also bullied by Flash Thompson, one of his classmates.</p>

            <p>Parker returned home from school, greeting his Aunt May and then mentioning a 'crazy car' parked outside the apartment building. The presence of Tony Stark, his biggest idol, in the living room caught Parker off-guard and left him speechless. Parker became confused when Stark told his aunt that Stark Industries planned to give him a sizable grant, claiming that Parker had signed up for it in the past, which he had not.</p>
