            <h1>War Machine</h1>
            <p>Colonel James Rupert "Rhodey" Rhodes is an officer with the United States Air Force and liaison between the military in the Department of Acquisitions and Stark Industries, where he became close friends with Tony Stark. When Stark had been kidnapped by the Ten Rings, Rhodes personally led a mission to rescue his best friend. However, upon their return, Rhodes saw Stark moving away from developing his weapons for the military and soon discovered that he was instead focusing on becoming a hero known as Iron Man. Despite all of his fears for his friend's safety, Rhodes still joined Iron Man in bringing down Obadiah Stane's schemes, while trying to keep Stark's secrets, only for Stark to reveal them to the media himself.</p>
            <h3>Early Life</h3>
            <p>James Rhodes first met Tony Stark at a young age as the two of them had become best friends, in a close bond/rivalry that would last their entire lives. When he grew older, Rhodes was promoted to the Lieutenant Colonel and, due to his continued friendship with Stark, also became the liaison between Stark Industries and the United States Armed Forces.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As Tony Stark had represented the newest weapon to the US Military at the Yuma Proving Ground. Stark's secretary Pepper Potts gave the weapon's specifics to all the generals while he and Rhodes went to a nightclub. Stark enjoyed the company of two girls while Rhodes had then attempted to convince him not to go to Afghanistan. Stark was attacked by a man whose girlfriend he previously seduced, as Rhodes had defeated the attacker. Later, Stark, Rhodes, and all the girls went into Tony Stark's Mansion in order to continue their party.</p>

            <img class="textpic" alt="Rhodes presenting an award to Tony Stark" src="Rhodes_award.jpg">
            <p>Rhodes was invited to attend an award ceremony at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas in order to present Tony Stark with an award for all of his work. As Rhodes stood on the stage, he told the audience that he felt that it was an honor to be the liaison between Stark Industries and the United States Armed Forces, calling Stark a true patriot and a close friend.</p>
            <br>
            <img class="textpic" alt="War Machine" src="WarMachineInAction.jpg">
            <p>However, as it turned out, Stark was not in attendance as he did not come to the stage when Rhodes called him. As the entire audience applauded for Stark, Obadiah Stane had instead accepted the award from Rhodes in Stark's honor. While Rhodes stood to the back of the room, he listened while Stane claimed that the reason Stark was not at the ceremony to collect the award in person would be because he was still working, which Rhodes knew would be highly unlikely.</p>
