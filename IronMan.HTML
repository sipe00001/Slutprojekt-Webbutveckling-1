            <h1>Iron Man</h1>
            <p>Anthony Edward Stark was born on Friday, May 29, 1970, in Manhattan, New York City, to Howard and Maria Stark. Tony had become good friends with Edwin Jarvis, the butler of Stark's family, who watched over Tony throughout all of his childhood. Tony's early life was often dominated by the absence of his own father who he would later describe as both 'cold' and 'calculating'. Growing up, Tony had issues with his father, who Tony has said never told his son that he loved him, or even that he liked him. Since Tony was so young, Howard never was able to tell him his plans for him.</p>

            <p>Tony's father would constantly talk about Captain America, to inspire Tony to do great things in life, which highly annoyed him. At an early age, Stark quickly stole the spotlight with his brilliant and unique mind. When he was four years old, he made his first circuit board. When he was almost seven, he built a V8 motorbike engine. At sixteen, he won the 4th Annual MIT Robot Design Award. When Tony was seventeen, he graduated summa cum laude from Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he also met James Rhodes, and they became best friends. One thing about Tony's childhood that annoyed him was the nanny that cared for him until he was fourteen. While he was in high school, Stark hacked into the Pentagon on a dare by some friends.</p>
            <p>In December 1991, when Stark was just twenty-one, Howard and Maria prepared to go away for a few days and leave him alone, although his father remained skeptical about how responsible Tony would be while they were gone. Sadly, they died in a "car crash" in Long Island, leading Stark to become driven in grief for their deaths. For a few months, Howard's business partner Obadiah Stane took over as interim CEO of Stark Industries until Tony officially assumed the role shortly after. Sometime later, Tony's long-serving family butler, Edwin Jarvis, also died.</p>
